# Simple-Chess-Engine
Simple Chess engine based on C 
The Simple chess engine is based on C and currently takes the Start FEN notation and generates all the possible first moves and makes the undo the move so that various conditions are tested whether all the possible moves are happening. And gives out a notation of FromTo format.
Example e4e5q means from e4 to e5 for the queen position. 

The basic setup takes each every FEN from a GUI based system and makes a move. But here no GUI is integrated we might have to give the FEN noaton for each move and MakeMove file creates all the possible moves. Amd Undo move function called as TakeMove which is also present int MakeMove file.
The FEN noation can be generated by https://lichess.org/editor sites to check the possible moves.

The unit testing part is included with chess.c where all initial starting moves are generated.
